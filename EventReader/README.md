# EventReader
`PyRootSimEventReader.py` is an example for how to read in .sim and .tra files generated by megalib and dump relevant information from each event into pandas dataframes. A bunch of "summary" dataframes are also generated (e.g. number of events per true and reconstructed event type in each input file).
